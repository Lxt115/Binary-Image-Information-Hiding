# Binary Image Information Hiding

This repository contains MATLAB code for binary image information hiding. It provides functions for hiding information in binary images and extracting hidden information from them.

## Usage

1. Use MATLAB functions to implement information hiding in binary images.
2. Use MATLAB functions to extract hidden information from binary images.
3. Analyze the impact of threshold values R0 and R1, as well as the robustness parameter λ, on the experimental results.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you saved the code.
3. Run the MATLAB functions related to information hiding or information extraction, depending on your requirements.
4. Modify the threshold values R0 and R1, as well as the robustness parameter λ, to observe their effects on the experimental results.
